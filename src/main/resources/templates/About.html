		<h2>Used Thymeleaf to create frontend</h2>
		
		<p>Thymeleaf is a Java template engine for processing and creating HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and text.

The library is extremely extensible, and its natural templating capability ensures we can prototype templates without a back end. This makes development very fast when compared with other popular template engines such as JSP.</p>
